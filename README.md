# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles set up for quick set up relevant CLI tools on different platform.

I create this in order to allow for a quick set up of familiar tool and environments as I move from terminal to terminal.

# Requirement

The application set up using GNU STOW for simple management.

Run this follow commands on Ubuntu 22.04 distro WSL2. 

```bash
sudo apt install stow
```

Each application is set up to run as a separate packages so you can choose which to set up on you local system.
